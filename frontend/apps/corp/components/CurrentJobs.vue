          <h1>Hiring Process</h1>

                Applying: We will review your application for the relevant skills
                required for the role, prior work experience, and communication
                abilities. We will follow up with you within one week upon receipt

                Initial Meeting: A 20-minute meeting with the Hiring Manager to
                determine if we should proceed to a formal interview. This is an
                excellent opportunity for you to ask questions about the role and
                System Initiative. We believe it&#x27;s vital that you get the
                information required to decide if the position and System
                Initiative are right for you. We will follow up with you within
                three working days after the meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engineering Assessment: Before proceeding to a formal interview,
                we want to ensure you have the requisite technical skills for the
                role. The
                <a href="https://github.com/systeminit/coding-assessment-sde3">Software engineer assessment</a> or <a href="https://github.com/systeminit/coding-assessment-sde3-frontend-focused">Frontend focused 
                  assessment</a>
                should take you no more than 4 hours.

              </li>
              <li>
                Interview: 4 ~45-minute Interviews. We will articulate whom you
                are meeting with and the specific topics we are looking to discuss
                in each Interview. We will cover your technical skills, prior work
                experience, problem-solving ability, communication skills,
                behavioral work style, and personality characteristics.
                Additionally, we will provide you with detailed information about
                the company and any other information you would like to understand
                better. We will follow up with you within one working day of the
                Interview.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reference Checks: Before making an offer, we would like to speak
                with the 2 to 3 references you have provided to understand better
                what it&#x27;s like to work with you.
                <strong>We will never contact your current employer without your permission.
                </strong
                >
                We try to complete reference checks as quickly as possible.

              </li>
              <li>
                Offer: We believe giving our best offer upfront is the right
                approach for us and new employees. We research several factors to
                determine a market rate offer and target cash and equity
                compensation at the high end of the range. This approach allows us
                to be fair to everyone we extend offers to and not have
                discrepancies in salary and equity compensation. Additionally, we
                will articulate pertinent details about medical benefits, 401k,
                paid time off (PTO) policy, and other essential items.
