# Todo

## Refactor

- State Management

## Improvements

- ZoomFactor should always be dynamic. If the user scrolls while dragging, the zoomFactor should update.
- Spacebar should maximize/minimize panel.
- Socket labels should not be interactive, so that they don't occlude the node when clicking on a node. (the socket object should be a container.)

## Look and feel

- background grid (SVG was better, should consider reverting to using an SVG instead of webGL)
  > SVG is sharper, and renders much better.
