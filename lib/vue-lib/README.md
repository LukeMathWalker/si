# @si/vue-lib

Place to keep any vue/frontend related tools that are going to be shared between other repos.

Note this is not for vue components / ui library, they (will) go in @si/ui-lib.

Put more general typescript tools that could be useful in a backend context in @si/ts-lib.

Some things may split into their own repos if they grow enough or start to look like good candidates for open sourcing,
but this should be an easy enough place to put things without too much overhead.
